## tr;be (tristan bennett) web portfolio, built with React
<br>
I built this version of my web portfolio both to make it more dynamic for future changes, but also to continue developing my React skills. I hope you enjoy!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode with parcel.<br>
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
This will create a .cache and a dist folder with the parcel bundled project.

### `npm start`

Builds the app for production (npm run build) to the `build` folder and opens it in the broswer with live-server.<br>

### `parcel build`

The build is bundled by parcel and ready to be deployed!

https://contours.axismaps.com/#7/47.027/-159.285 is the exact coordinates of the images, from the pacific seabed
