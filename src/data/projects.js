		description: "An app I made for the freeCodeCamp curriculum that randomly generates different translations of the idiom 'It\'s all Greek to me' and their transliterations. For this app many people used third-party APIs to source their random quotes, but I thought it would be more interesting to create my own object of translated idioms instead and randomly generate the idiom in different langauges.",
